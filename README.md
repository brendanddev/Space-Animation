# Space-Animation
This was an exercise completed by me in my Java class, which I have expanded on within my own interest.
This 'Space Animation' focuses on some fundamental principals in Java, such as inheritance, assosciation, and more.
The goal of this project is to simulate space using Java, and JavaFX to create animations.
